NOTE: asciinema is being rewritten in Rust (https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/milestone/8)

Therefore we don't accept any new features (no matter how small) into the 2.x version.

Bugfixes to existing functionality are welcome, however it's recommended to discuss the changes
upfront with the team in our Matrix room - https://matrix.to/#/#asciinema:matrix.org
or in our IRC channel - https://web.libera.chat/#asciinema
